## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Meeting deadlines ensures clients satisfaction since they can receive their product on time, project management costs are within budget. It is also a sense of standard in a competitive market building a good reputation and reliability.
Projectt managers ensure deadlines are met by planning and setting goals having in mind task prioritization, efficient use of resources, mitigation of risks after identifying them,effective communication and monitoring team work.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control contributes to the success of a software project in that it manages budget and prevents cost overruns.
Budget overruns can be prevented by priority in task allocation, having a 10-30% increament on the budget calculated to avoid under budgeting and having to spend more as a consequence, effective planning and having team members adhere to timetables and schedules. Goal setting is also helpful to avoid dragging of tasks.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile software project management is iterative and increamental in its approach whereas the Waterfall management uses the approach of linearity and sequenciality.
Agile method has the advantages of flexibility to changes, regular feedback from customers and team collaboration but lacks predictability and requires a lot of customer involvement.
Waterfall method has the advantages of clear structure hence easy to document and manage but it is difficult to initiate and accommodate changes and since testing comes later in the process..

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is ideal where projects require evolving requirements or frequent changes as it is being done as well as continuous feedback and collaboration with the product users. It is useful in e-commerce website development and digital marketing campains.
Waterfall methodology is ideal where projects have clear goals and requirements hence not needing changes and low client involvement.Examples are construction projects and government projects.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Quality assurance can be achieved through code reviews and walkthroughs by team members after every milestone achieved and at the end. High standards maintenance is important to ensure customer satisfaction, company reliability and increased customer preference.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
A project scope gives life to the meaningfulness of a project by defining targets/boundaries and objectives. 
A work breakdown structure highlights the steps and procedures to be taken in a project for a given time schedule or to meet the user needs. It is therefore useful in achieving deadlines, paying attention to customer urgency, costs management, support from investors and consumers of the end product, risks are predictable hence preparation for mitigations are done early.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
A detailed project schedule ensures work is done within schedule, goals are met and therefore deadlines are not overdue. Gantt charts track progress and identify in accordance to cost performance delays through visual representation of the project's schedule.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
  -Reliability to problem emergency.
  -Relevancy to real world problems
  -Consumability. What kind of people are going to be the ultimate consumers.
  -User friendliness and adaptability.
  Since real world problems affect the society/community at large, addressing these needs are significant to address the target audience livelihoods who are people who make up the society .i.e., children, men and women who are both young and old.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Clear problem definition ensures the understanding of pain points that connect to the broader problem illustrating the problem's impact hence giving a clear direction in formulation of the solution.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
By highlighting the key features and functionalities that make the solution effective.

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
-Cost affordability and ease of use interface to consumers.
-performance and speed of the product in addressing the problem.
-cross platform compatibility
-Reliability and efficiency.
-customer support
-workflow automation to help in redundant manual effort(s).

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Data obtained from credible sources and up-to-date statistics such as self/in-person field research activities, government publications and other research works conducted by experts are helpful in evaluating market size and its potential growth.
